### [Reference article](http://digitalfortress.tech/tricks/creating-a-global-gitignore/) to setup a **global .gitignore** file

### [Reference article](https://digitalfortress.tech/tutorial/create-global-gitconfig-git-alias/) to setup a **global .gitconfig** file as well as **git alias**


#### The default .gitconfig file is located at *~/.gitconfig* (For Unix systems alone. See above article for other OS's).
